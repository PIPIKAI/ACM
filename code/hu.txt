Stephen Hawking gave three suggestions to his children. Though he was disable at the young age, his love for his children was as strong as other fathers. The first suggestion is to remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. The second is to never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. The last is that if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is rare, and don¡¯t throw it away.
